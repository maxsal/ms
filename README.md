# ms

An R package of functions I've found useful.

## Installation
```
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("maxsal/ms")
```
## Future work

- `phe_desc` - a function for mapping phecodes to their descriptions and other metadata (both Phecode 1.2 and X mapping tables)
- Functions for mapping ICD9CM and ICD10CM codes to their descriptions and, potentially, other metadata
