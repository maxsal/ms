# ms

An R package of functions I've found useful.

## Installation
```
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("maxsal/ms")
```
## Future work

- `phe_desc` - a function for mapping phecodes to their descriptions and other metadata (both Phecode 1.2 and X mapping tables; see [PheWAS resources](https://phewascatalog.org) and the [`PheWAS` R package](https://github.com/PheWAS/PheWAS))
- Functions for mapping ICD9CM and ICD10CM codes to their descriptions and, potentially, other metadata (e.g., [ICD10CM data](https://www.icd10data.com))
